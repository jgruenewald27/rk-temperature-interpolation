# Assessing the Impact of Open-Data Environmental Variables on Temperature Predictions Using Regression-Kriging

## Primary Research Goals
This study incorporates high-temporal-resolution air temperature data from weather measurement stations to account for city-scale differences in climatic and environmental conditions. In order to quantify intra-urban temperature variability and meet the demand for spatially continuous climatological datasets (Sukkuea & Heednacram 2022; Wu & Li 2013). Regression Kriging is applied to estimate continuous air-temperature surfaces across the city, including areas where direct observations are unavailable. Next to air temperature, elevation, tree canopy height and building height will be included as covariates, as their influence on thermal comfort is widely cited (Deilami et al. 2020; Foshag et al. 2024; Güller
& Toy 2024; Ludwig et al. 2021). The resulting high-resolution continuous temperature grids provide a valuable addition to the existing city-wide location-based air temperature measurements, with the potential to enhance heat-adaptive routing by offering a subjective representation of thermal conditions at the neighbourhood scale.

## Fundamental research questions of this thesis:
-  How reliably can hourly patterns of urban temperature be captured across different meteorological conditions?
- Which covariates are most influential in explaining temperature variability, and how does their significance vary across different times of day and weather conditions?
- What role do data quality and the spatial distribution of temperature measurements play in shaping the performance of interpolation models?
